#Goal: Map with custom markers on it. Content card (“Grand Canyon”) is bonus content.
 
## what has been done so far:
1. User opens the screen and sees his/ friends’ markers on screen
2. Clicking on a marker opens a simple card at the bottom.
3. Clicking in an “empty” map area hides the card.

## todos:
1. Redesign markers and card details to match the design with possible animations
3. load markers data from BE or retrieve from the state if already exists
2. search how to only pin the markers once the map is fully loaded.
